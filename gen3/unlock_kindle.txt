Steps unlock bootloader and needed files
this is the details step for unlocking bootloader for the 2013 Kindle HDX 7 (Thor) and HDX 8.9 (Apollo). Be carefull the 2014 HDX 8.9 (Saturn) doesn't work!
These steps are done in Windows 10, successfully checked by myself! 
I don't take any credits, just collect all the steps in one post of the whole process.

Download the needed files are in the attachment, just download them all + the TWRP for your device from this thread: TWRP 3.1.1-1
You do NOT need root for these steps!

1. Install the adb-setup-1.4.3 into a folder (for example: C:/adb), extract dd-0.5.zip + unlock.zip + aboot-xxx.zip, put dd.exe + get_code.bat + unlock.bat + twrp image (for your device) + aboot_vuln.mbn (for your device) into that folder. After that install the kindle_fire_usb_driver.

2. Turn on ADB-Debuging Mode in Developer Mod by tapping 7 times the build numbers in settings and connect to your computer + trust your device.

3. Execute "get_code.bat" in the folder above, you will get a new file: unlock.code in the folder.

4. Open CMD in the folder and run "adb reboot bootloader", the Kindle will reboot to bootloader with "[ fastboot ]" on the display

5. On the Computer go to Device-Manager and change driver in "Other Android" to "Fire Devices - Android Adb Composite Driver" . It should say "Ready" on the Kindle.

6. Now we need to enter Bulk-Mode like the instruction in this thread: Bulk Mode

fastboot -i 0x1949 erase aboot
fastboot -i 0x1949 reboot
IMPORTANT:
This will be scary as you'll lose 'fastboot' and only see a black screen.
Your device should reboot into "bulk mode" resulting in a number of pop-up
windows asking to format all the partitions that get exposed (at least, on Windows 10).

DO NOT format anything! Follow the above instructions instead.

7. Open a command window (cmd) and run the following commands:

wmic partition where index=22 get diskindex
wmic partition where (index=17 and numberofblocks=20480) get diskindex
wmic partition where (index=5 and numberofblocks=4096) get diskindex
All three of the above commands should return the same DiskIndex. Let's call that index X.

8. In the command window, run the following two commands with the right aboot&twrp files for your device
(you will need to substitute the DiskIndex X from above in place of the X):

dd of=\\?\Device\HarddiskX\Partition6 if=aboot_vuln.mbn
dd of=\\?\Device\HarddiskX\Partition18 if=twrp_cubed.img

This error message on the first command seems normal: "Error reading file: 87 The parameter is incorrect"
NB: make sure you run both commands! Without TWRP, you'll get a brick.

Wait a few minutes for good measure; then, keep holding Power + VolUp until your device enters TWRP.

9. When done, hold down the power button until it reboots. Now you will be at Bootloader with [Fastboot] sign on the screen. Change the drive in Device-Manager again if needed.

10. Run the "unlock.bat" in the folder and you should get a green line: "unlock code is correct". Congrats your Kindle now has an unlocked bootloader.

11. Now hold power button again to shut down the device, then hold both "power button + Volume UP" and keep them for 3-5 seconds after you see the "kindle fire" logo. Then you will get into the TWRP and flash your desire things.
